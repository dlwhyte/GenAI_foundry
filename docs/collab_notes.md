## 📚 What is Google Colab?

- A cloud-hosted version of Jupyter Notebooks.
- Provides free access to CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
- Supports Python libraries with easy installation.
- Great for quick experiments, tutorials, and AI development.

Colab makes it simple to explore and experiment with machine learning, data science, and generative AI without setting up a local environment.
