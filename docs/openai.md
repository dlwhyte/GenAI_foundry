# 🔑 How to Get an OpenAI API Key

This guide walks you through creating an OpenAI account and obtaining an API key for the course demos.

---

## Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

1. Go to **[platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)**

2. Click **"Sign up"** (top right corner)

3. You can sign up using:
   - Email address (you'll need to verify it)
   - Google account
   - Microsoft account
   - Apple account

4. Complete the verification process (check your email if required)

5. You may be asked to provide a phone number for verification

## Step 2: Navigate to API Keys

1. Once logged in, click on your **profile icon** (top right corner)

2. Select **"View API keys"** from the dropdown menu

   *Or go directly to: [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)*

---

## Step 3: Create a New API Key

1. Click the **"+ Create new secret key"** button

2. Give your key a name (optional but helpful), for example:
   - `MIT GenAI Course`
   - `Learning Demo`

3. Click **"Create secret key"**

4. **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Your key will be displayed **only once**. It looks like this:
   ```
   sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

5. Click the **copy icon** to copy the key

6. **Save it somewhere safe** (password manager, secure note, etc.)

## Step 4: Add Payment Method (Required for API Usage)

OpenAI requires a payment method to use the API. The demos use minimal credits.

1. Go to **[platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)**

2. Click **"Add payment method"**

3. Enter your credit card or debit card details

4. Add credits to your account:
   - Click **"Add to credit balance"**
   - **$5-10 is more than enough** for this course
   - Credits don't expire for 12 months

---

## Step 5: Set Usage Limits (Recommended)

Protect yourself from unexpected charges:

1. Go to **[platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits)**

2. Set a **monthly budget limit** (e.g., $10)

3. Optionally set an **email notification threshold** (e.g., $5)

---

## Step 6: Use Your Key in the Demo

1. Run the demo application (see main README)

2. Enter your API key in the **sidebar** where it says "OpenAI API Key"

3. The key is only stored in your browser session — it's never saved

## 💰 Cost Estimate

The Ontology demo uses GPT-4o-mini, which is very affordable:

| Action | Approximate Cost |
|--------|-----------------|
| One counterfactual analysis | ~$0.001 (fraction of a cent) |
| 100 analyses | ~$0.10 |
| Full course usage | < $1.00 |

**$5 in credits is more than enough for the entire course.**

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
|-------|---------|
| Store your key in a password manager | Share your key with others |
| Set spending limits | Post your key on GitHub or public sites |
| Regenerate key if exposed | Hardcode key in applications |
| Delete unused keys | Leave old keys active |

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"
- Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with `sk-`)
- Check for extra spaces before or after the key
- Verify the key is still active at [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### "You exceeded your current quota"
- Add credits at [platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
- Or wait until your monthly limit resets

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait a few seconds and try again
- This happens if you make too many requests quickly

### Can't create account
- Try a different browser
- Disable VPN if using one
- Some countries have restrictions — check OpenAI's supported regions
